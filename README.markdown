# JSONArrayAdapter

An easy adapter to map JSON data to views defined in an XML layout. 

Basically a wrapper around [android.widget.SimpleAdapter](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleAdapter.html) that maps data from a [org.json.JSONArray](http://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONArray.html) instance.
